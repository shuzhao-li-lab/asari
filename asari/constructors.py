Empirical Compound, list and tree
=================================
Constructing trees of emperical compounds (epdTree) from a list of peaks or features,
which follow a format:
list_peaks: [{'parent_masstrace_id': 1670, 'mz': 133.09702315984987, 'apex': 654, 'height': 14388.0, 
                    'left_base': 648, 'right_base': 655, 'id_number': 555}, ...]

Steps:
1. find isotopic signatures from list_peaks
2. initiate epdTree classes using the above isotopic signatures; extend by searching common adducts
3. In remaining peaks (isotopes not seen due to low intensity etc), search pairs for primary adducts. 
   Initiate epdTree classes using those.
4. Extend to other adducts for empCpds from the above steps.
5. Reconsolidate overlap epdTrees. E.g. combinations of isotopes and adducts are found separately.

Notes:
a. Common anchor peaks are M+H or M-H etc, but will calculate at later round. M* may not show.
b. Adducts and isotopes are combinatorial, under restriction of chemical formulae.
c. We curated isotopic/adduct patterns in this package.
d. epdTree can be improved in future based on real data statistics and more structured cheminformatics.

class CompositeMap:
    '''
    The CMap is consisted of a list of massTraces, which contain Peaks.
    Steps:
    1. Among the initial samples, the sample of most empCpds is used to seed the CMap.
    2. EmpCpds from each sample are aligned to the seed sample (mass_epdtree_mapping),
    then CMap is augmented by matched empCpds not in the seed sample. This step establishes m/z grid.
    3. Optional, m/z calibration to refDB.
    4. Determine RT DTW function per sample, by matching to selective epd pairs.
    5. Build composite elution profile by cumulative sum of mass traces from all samples after RT correction.
    6. New samples are added to CMap, both aligning to the CMap and augment the CMap by new features.
    7. After all samples are processed, peak detection is performed carefully on each massTrace in CMap, 
    to determine number and range of peaks.
    8. Report peaks per sample based on the peak definition in CMap.
    9. New round of Annotation; add remaining features to epds or group into new epds.

class epdsConstructor:
    '''
    To organize a table of peaks/features into a list of empirical compounds
    (https://github.com/shuzhao-li/metDataModel).
    empCpds (or epds) can be initiated by signatures on isotopic relationships or adduct relationships.
    For low-intensity peaks, their isotopic counterparts may not be detectable.
    Only common adducts are considered at this step.
    This list of epds are used in m/z alignment/correspondence.
    For assigned peaks/features, will calculate selectivity/score later too.
